title: Climate modelling in Excel...
---
You can download the implementation of the FaIRv2.0 model in Excel described in this post [here]({{ site.url }}/download/FaIRv2.0.0-alpha.zip "NOTE: I've only tested this workbook on my virtual Windows machine. Though it has worked for several others on both macOS and Windows machines, it has also been known to break, for reasons that are unclear to me... debugging Excel is a pain.").

This is a brief post that introduces an Excel version of the FaIRv2.0 model[<sup>1</sup>](#1) that I've created. I go through some of the key features, suggest some experiments that you can do, and explain how to carry out a few different types of analyses with the model.<!--more-->
