title: The heatwave that never was
---
Around a month ago, the UK recorded temperatures of over 40Â°C for the first time - and over a remarkably large area. A few features of the heatwave struck me at the time: its unprecedented nature; how well-forecast it was; how seriously it was being taken in a decent chunk of the media; and how much of the discussion about it was framed about the unequivocal influence that human greenhouse gas emissions had on it. A couple of weeks prior to the peak of the heat, Simon Lee wrote [an excellent blog post](https://simonleewx.com/2022/07/06/40c-in-the-uk/) that covers a lot of what I'd say about these features, so that comes as recommended (though hopefully not essential) reading. In this post, I'm going to explore the question of: 'could an event like this have plausibly happened in the past?' And to do that, I'm taking you back to 2001...<!--more-->

Labour has just won a second term in office with a landslide majority. Tim Henman is looking strong at Wimbledon (come on Tim!). The weather, having been fairly unremarkable thus far over the summer, is starting to look like it might heat up. A 'dome' of high pressure / thicker troposphere has developed near the UK, and (top layer, specifically 0-7cm) soil moisture anomalies are relatively low.
