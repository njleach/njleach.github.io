title: ExSamples - Generating samples of extreme winters to support climate adaptation
---
I recently gave a talk about the work I've done in collaboration with several co-authors on the ExSamples project. This talk was part of the  [UKCRP webinar series](https://www.ukclimateresilience.org/news-events/exsamples-generating-samples-of-extreme-winters-to-support-climate-adaptation/). The aim of this project is to provide a proof-of-concept of a specific experiment design that could support existing climate projection efforts by more completely sampling the uncertainty surrounding the most extreme future events.<!--more-->
