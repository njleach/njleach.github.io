title: The FaIR DECK
---

A figure showing the idealised CMIP6 DECK reference experiments carried out using the FaIR probabilistic ensemble. <!--more-->The CMIP6 ensemble can be toggled on/off by clicking the legend item. Note that I've normalised the CMIP6 ensemble myself in this instance, so it may not line up perfectly with the literature, but it shouldn't be far off. <b>Full-page version [here]({{ site.base_url }}{% link _pages/FaIR-deck-experiments.md %})</b>.
