I am a PhD student on the [Environmental Research Doctoral Training Partnership](https://www.environmental-research.ox.ac.uk/) at Oxford University in his fourth and final year. I reside in the [Predictability of Weather and Climate research group](https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/predictability-of-weather-and-climate), supervised by Antje Weisheimer and Myles Allen. My research explores the use of operational weather forecasting models within the field of extreme event attribution, with a particular focus on heat events. This work touches on themes of numerical weather prediction, attribution of climate change, meteorological drivers of extreme weather and extreme value statistics.

I started out in climate change research during a summer research project (that I would develop into his masters thesis) investigating a simple method for estimating the remaining global carbon budget. While this particular field is no longer my focus, I still remain involved, especially in the use and development of reduced complexity climate models. I recently led a paper describing an update to the FaIR simple climate model.

I completed my masters degree in physics (MPhys) at Oxford University, specialising in the Physics of Atmospheres and Oceans, and Astrophysics. For more information on my background and experience you can find my CV [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ke_UVnF5HoJMO-T8L-gZQDUNUrJDG8QM9gtFZxgGUtg/edit?usp=sharing).
