I am a PhD student on the [Environmental Research Doctoral Training Partnership](https://www.environmental-research.ox.ac.uk/) at Oxford University. I reside in the [Predictability of Weather and Climate research group](https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/predictability-of-weather-and-climate), working with Antje Weisheimer and Myles Allen. My research explores the use of weather forecasting models within the field of extreme event attribution, with a particular focus on heat events. I am investigating how state-of-the-art weather forecasting models can be used indirectly to calibrate attribution analyses; and also to perform them directly. 

I started out in climate change research with a summer project (that I would into my masters thesis) looking into a method for estimating the remaining carbon budget. While this particular field is no longer my focus, I still remain involved in it, especially in the use and development of simple climate models. I recently led a paper describing an update to the FaIR simple climate model. 

I completed my masters degree in physics (MPhys) at Oxford University, specialising in the Physics of Atmospheres and Oceans, and Astrophysics. For more information on my background and experience you can find my CV [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c_ueyKmrRddf66eeiMvK-LUWpqrqEW9iJXrO03tGYLY/edit?usp=sharing).
